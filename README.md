### Node.js Project for Front-End Practice

This is a basic project built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and TypeScript to practice working with various front-end technologies.

**Running the Project**

1. **Development Mode**
```sh
npm run dev
```

2. **Building the Project**
```sh
npm run build
```

3. **Starting the Project**
```sh
npm start
```

---

I recommend using the Postman collection, which is already prepared for testing the project's functionality.
